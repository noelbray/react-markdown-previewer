# React Markdown Previewer
*__React Markdown Previewer is a Free Code Camp frontend challenge I completed on Codepen.__*

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**Instructions:** 

Read the information in the "Markdown Editor" to learn the appropriate markdown, pattern for italics, bold, blockquote, and more. 

Once you have entered, used the appropriate markdown pattern, in the "Markdown Editor," it will show up in the "Markdown Previewer." 

**Side Note:** 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
